## General
This is a Streamlined CLI-Based Core v2 Management Tool. 
- Installs fail2ban for ssh, and ufw allowing only ssh and the cores ports.
- For start/restart/stop/status/logs you can skip the 'all' argument as it's the default.
- For install/remove you can skip the 'core' argument as it's the default.
- For update you can skip the 'check' argument as it's the default.
- For system you can skip the 'info' argument as it's the default.
- For plugin you can skip the 'list' argument as it's the default.
- Using the 'restart safe' arguments requires the round-monitor core plugin and restarts the core services when safe to do so in 
order to avoid missing a block.
- When setting a delegate secret just type your secret after the 'set' argument without quotes.
- When doing a rollback just type the desired height after the 'rollback' argument.
- Rollback will stop the running processes, do the rollback and start the processes that were online.
- The script adds an alias named 'ccontrol' on first run. On your next shell login you'll be able to call the script from anywhere
using: ccontrol arg1 [arg2]. It also has autocomplete functionality for all possible arguments.
- Using the 'config reset' arguments will stop the core processes, delete your existing configs and replace them with the defaults.
If you're running a forger and/or have custom settings, you should add them again.
- Using the 'database clear' arguments will stop the core processes, wipe the database clean, and start the processes that were online before.
The end result is that your node will start syncing from 0.
- For plugin management just type the name of the plugin after 'plugin add/remove/update' as it appears in the list.
- On first run the tool exposes the core-cli with the project name, e.g. ark for project Ark. It will be accessible after logout.
- Do not run as root!
